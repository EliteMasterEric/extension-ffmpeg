# extension-ffmpeg

A Haxe library which provides support for handling video, audio, and multimedia files and streams on native platforms.

`extension-ffmpeg` boasts the following features:

- Decoding, display, and playback control for video and audio.
- Support for the most popular video formats, including `avi`, `mp4`, `webm`, `flv`, `mkv`, and more.
- Utilities for easy integration into OpenFL and HaxeFlixel.

Contributions are highly welcome! Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have any questions or suggestions.

## Building on Windows

To build `extension-ffmpeg` from source, perform these steps to fetch dependencies:
1. Do NOT download the repository by clicking the `Download ZIP` button on the Github page. 
- Instead, run `git clone https://github.com/MasterEric/extension-ffmpeg` to create a local Git repository.
2. Install Visual Studio 2019, installing the following components:
- `MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools`
- `Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)`
3. Install MSYS2. I installed to the `C:/CPP/msys64` directory.
4. Navigate to the project folder and call `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote` to download the source for FFmpeg.

Then, follow these steps:
1. Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019` and call `"C:\CPP\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd" -use-full-path`.
2. Call `pacman -Su git wget make tar unzip zip mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake autoconf automake libtool mingw-w64-x86_64-jq python zstd nasm` (one-time step).
3. Navigate to the project folder, enter `./lib.src/`, and run `./build_win64.sh` to build the `Windows64` library files.

Now, we need to build libraries for 32-bit machines.
  - This is necessary because `lime rebuild` performs two builds, one for each architecture.
1. Open `x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019` and call `"C:\CPP\msys64\msys2_shell.cmd" -use-full-path`.
3. Navigate to the project folder, enter `./lib.src/ffmpeg`, and run `make clean`.
  - This gets rid of any artifacts from the previous 64-bit build.
4. Move back to `./lib.src/` and run `build_win32.sh` to build the `Windows32` library files.

This will generate the necessary `.lib` files that you need to build the extension.

To build the extension itself, run `lime rebuild extension-ffmpeg windows`. 
You will need to repeat this step if you change any of the C++ files located in the `project` folder.
Be sure to run `lime rebuild extension-ffmpeg windows -debug` instead if you are planning to debug the target application.

# Building on Linux

To build `extension-ffmpeg` from source, follow these steps:
1. Do NOT download the repository by clicking the `Download ZIP` button on the Github page. 
- Instead, run `git clone https://github.com/MasterEric/extension-ffmpeg` to create a local Git repository.
2. Install these development packages:
    `libvdpau-dev libva-dev libx11-dev`
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Call `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote` to download the source for FFmpeg.
5. Navigate to `./lib.src/`.
6. Run `./build_linux64.sh`.
- You will need to repeat this step if you modify the compile flags in the script (which are used to build FFmpeg's libs).

This will generate the necessary `.a` files that you need to build the extension.

To build the extension itself, run `lime rebuild extension-ffmpeg linux`.
You will need to repeat this step if you change any of the C++ files located in the `project` folder.
Be sure to run `lime rebuild extension-ffmpeg linux -debug` instead if you are planning to debug the target application.

# Building on MacOS

To build `extension-ffmpeg` from source, follow these steps:
1. Do NOT download the repository by clicking the `Download ZIP` button on the Github page. 
- Instead, run `git clone https://github.com/MasterEric/extension-ffmpeg` to create a local Git repository.
2. Use [Brew](https://brew.sh/) or you can use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) to install dependencies:
- `brew install nasm openssl`
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Call `git submodule update --init --recursive --remote` to download the source for FFmpeg.
5. Navigate to `./lib.src/`.
6. Run `./build_mac64.sh`.
- You will need to repeat this step if you modify the compile flags in the script (which are used to build FFmpeg's libs).

This will generate the necessary `.a` files that you need to build the extension.

To build the extension itself, run `lime rebuild extension-ffmpeg mac`.
You will need to repeat this step if you change any of the C++ files located in the `project` folder.
Be sure to run `lime rebuild extension-ffmpeg mac -debug` instead if you are planning to debug the target application.

## Building for android

To build `extension-ffmpeg` from source, follow these steps:
1. Download and unzip the android ndk (r23c)
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Call `git submodule update --recursive` to download the source for FFmpeg.
4. Navigate to `./lib.src/`.
5. Change the ndk path in `build_android64.sh` to your ndk path,
5. Run `./build_android64.sh`.

This will generate the necessary `.a` files that you need to build the extension.

To build the extension itself, run `lime rebuild extension-ffmpeg android`.

this is still on testing, only 64 bits is supported as of now

## Building on Other Platforms

Support for other platforms (Android, iOS, HTML5 via emscripten) is in development.
